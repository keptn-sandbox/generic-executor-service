# Release Notes 0.8.0

This version now supports Keptn 0.8.x. It also gives you more flexibility with accessing the incoming event data that triggers your script.

## New Features

Check out the readme where we describe the different ways to access the incoming Keptn event data fields.

## Fixed Issues

Better error handling and also included a VERBOSE_LOGGING environment variable that can be set to true!

## Known Limitations

Remember that your scripts run in the context and within the generic-executor-service container. That means you are constraint to the role of that container.
